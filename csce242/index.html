                        In this assignment, I created a basic HTML webpage about a topic of my choice.
                        I used a simple layout and added the most basic elements to the webpage such as
                        headers, paragraphs, images, lists, and links. 
                    </p>
                </a>

                    <p>
                        For this assignment, I created another simple webpage using most of the same
                        elements from the previous assignment. However, this time I used a CSS stylesheet
                        to make the website look visually appealing.
