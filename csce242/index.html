                        In this assignment, I created a basic HTML webpage about a topic of my choice.
                        I used a simple layout and added the most basic elements to the webpage such as
                        headers, paragraphs, images, lists, and links. 
                    </p>
                </a>

                    <img src="images/assignment_2_ss.png">
                    <p>
                        For this assignment, I created another simple webpage using most of the same
                        elements from the previous assignment. However, this time I used a CSS stylesheet
                        to make the website look visually appealing. 
                    </p>

                    <img src="images/assignment_3_ss.png">
                    <p>
                        In this assignment, I created a new webpage with the main objective of
                        recreating a layout that was given to us. I used a CSS stylesheet to try
                        to make the webpage look identical. I utilized media queries to make two
                        different views for the webpage.
