                        In this assignment, I created a basic HTML webpage about a topic of my choice.
                        I used a simple layout and added the most basic elements to the webpage such as
                        headers, paragraphs, images, lists, and links.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For this assignment, I created another simple webpage using most of the same
                        elements from the previous assignment. However, this time I used a CSS stylesheet
                        to make the website look visually appealing.

                    <p>
                        In this assignment, I created a new webpage with the main objective of
                        recreating a layout that was given to us. I used a CSS stylesheet to try
                        to make the webpage look identical. I utilized media queries to make two
                        different views for the webpage.

                    <p>
                        For this assignment, I was given the link to the UofSC graduate school
                        admissions page. Using an html and more new tools on the stylesheet,
                        I recreated the page as closely as possible.

                    <p>
                        In this assignment, I recreated another webpage, but this time using
                        Javascript to allow for interaction on the page. I used an html, a stylesheet,
                        and a script.js file to make three different interactions possible.

                        This PDF outlines my topic for my Mockitt webpage. I am creating a webpage called "Discover Japan"
                        which is a travel site for people interested in vacationing in Japan. It includes 5 pages: Home,
                        Destinations, Cultural Experiences, Cuisine, and Travel tips.

                        I used Mockitt to Wireframe my webpage including the 5 different pages listed in my topic outline.
                        Each page has different visuals and features to create a simple experience for users. This webpage
                        design includes all the basic elements that you would need to plan your dream trip to Japan.
