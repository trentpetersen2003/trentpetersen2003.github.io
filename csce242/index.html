                    <p>
                        I created a basic HTML webpage about a topic of my choice.
                        I used a simple layout and added the most basic elements to the webpage such as
                        headers, paragraphs, images, lists, and links.

                        I created another simple webpage using most of the same
                        elements from the previous assignment. However, this time I used a CSS stylesheet
                        to make the website look visually appealing.

                        I created a new webpage with the main objective of
                        recreating a layout that was given to us. I used a CSS stylesheet to try
                        to make the webpage look identical. I utilized media queries to make two
                        different views for the webpage.

                        I was given the link to the UofSC graduate school
                        admissions page. Using an html and more new tools on the stylesheet,
                        I recreated the page as closely as possible.

                        I recreated another webpage, but this time using
                        Javascript to allow for interaction on the page. I used an html, a stylesheet,
                        and a script.js file to make three different interactions possible.

                        I created a single page that allows you to switch between
                        two different exercises. One is a color slider, and the other is a picture chooser.
                        This was made possible by combining an html, a stylesheet, and a script.js.

                        I created a single-page application that allows the user to draw a specified number 
                        of stars in random positions within a container. The page was built by integrating 
                        HTML for structure, a CSS stylesheet for styling, and a script.js file for 
                        functionality, making it possible to dynamically generate stars based on user input.

                        I developed a single-page layout that displays a grid of character images. When an 
                        image is clicked, a corresponding title and description appear above the grid. This 
                        functionality was implemented using HTML for structure, CSS for styling and layout, 
                        and a script.js file to handle the image data and click events.

                        I created a webpage with bird cards displaying their names above their images. 
                        Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, each card is dynamically generated, and clicking 
                        on a card opens a modal with detailed bird information. The styling and layout 
                        match the provided design, ensuring a clean and interactive display.

                        styled grid layout. Each image has a hover effect that reveals the name of the ice cream.

                        which is a travel site for people interested in vacationing in Japan. It includes 5 pages: Home,
                        Destinations, Cultural Experiences, Cuisine, and Travel tips.

                        Each page has different visuals and features to create a simple experience for users. This webpage
                        design includes all the basic elements that you would need to plan your dream trip to Japan.

                        Following the wireframe I created on Mockitt, I made an HTML and a CSS to create a prototype
                        for my webpage "Discover Japan". I matched the webpage to the Mockitt as closely as possible,
                        with some minor changes that I believed to be improvements.

                        the website, and I added photos in place of all of the placeholder images.

                        But, I also made some smaller cosmetic changes to make some of the pages look better.

                        Finally, I added a JSON file that is parsed and displayed onto my cuisine page.
