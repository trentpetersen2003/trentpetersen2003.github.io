        <h3>About the Game</h3>
        <p>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, more commonly referred to in the gaming community as "Skyrim",
        is a video game that released November 11th, 2011 for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, and
        Playstation 3. Skyrim is an open world RPG (Role-playing Game) set in a fantasy world full
        of magic and mythical creatures. When dragons once again plague the land of Skyrim, it is
        up to you to put a stop to them. Using your special powers as the "Dragonborn", you must
        find out how the dragons have returned and save Skyrim.</p>

        <h3>Personal Opinion</h3>
        <p>Skyrim is my favorite game of all time for many reasons. One of the best parts about
        the game is that there are so many options, you can play it over and over again and
        get a new experience every time. The character customization allows you to choose from
        a variety of different mythical races, each with their own unique traits and abilites.
        There are also many different options when it comes to combat; you can play it stealthy
        by being a sneaky archer, get up close and personal with a sword and shield, or even learn
        hundreds of different magic spells to cast at your enemies. On top of that, there are
        many different factions you can join in the game. You can choose to join the Empire or
        the Stormcloacks in their war for rule over Skyrim, or you can become a vampire hunter by
        joining the Dawnguard, and if you're feeling mischievous you can join criminal factions
        like the thieves guild or the assassins brotherhood.</p>
